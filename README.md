# Spaceship-Hybrid-Game

This project is a hybrid game that includes a React interface for two players that connects through wifi to an electronic board wired with an Arduino UN to create a unique gaming experience.

## Summary

The Spaceship-Hybrid-Game is composed of two main parts: The electronic board and the React Interface. However, the game itself is about two survivors on a spaceship that has been infested with alien parasites. They have to collaborate by clearing four rooms and setting the ship for self-destruction. The electronic board is a made out of a piece of cardboard with a printed image in the top. The board has LEDs, and sound pieces that work as the physical pieces to provide information of where you are and what is happening on the game. The React App would be the mechanism of the user to control their own actions. The interface should include one button for each room to give the ability to move to these. It should also include the a button for the other two actions the player can do which are: Killing an Alien and Setting a room to self-destruct.
